# Space-Flight-Kivy-App

This Project will create a game in which the player has to manover his spaceship with fast reflexes. My goal is to learn about the Kivy liraray and to create my first cross platfrom app. The resource I use for studying is a Youtube course by CodeWithJonathan. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8Imtec4ReQ&list=LL&index=1

## How to get started

## Technology and Concepts

In order to get Kvy to work on Wndows 10 it was neccessary for me to use a virtual environment to run my app in. This is highly recommended because otherwise there would be no shortage of version conflicts of python and other packages. So each time I open a new console, I must run the following script to activate the virtual environment: kivy_venv\Scripts\activate
